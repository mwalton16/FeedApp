The requirements.txt file is a list of all of the libraries we will need for the project and their respective versions. Because these are installed through the terminal,
and not through the code, other users of the code would not know what programs needed to be used. For simplicity and efficiency, the requirements.txt file lists the
required libraries so someone else can just install all the required libraries with the following code:
pip install -r requirements.txt

The below code creates the database for the project, db.sqlite3.
py manage.py migrate
